      <description>As someone who has grown up around the sport of softball, I’ve watched hundreds of games. My sister played softball in college and little did I know that years later I would be working for the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s softball team.

      <description>The University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s volleyball team is known for being one of the best volleyball teams in the nation. They seem to be always ranked and have won five National Championships, most recently in 2015 and 2017. With UNL football’s seasons recently, some UNL students have referred to UNL as a “volleyball school”. When the Huskers play in Lincoln at the Bob Devaney Sports Center, the Huskers always have a full stadium and true fans cheering them on.</description>
